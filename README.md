## What is Totoro Kana?

Totoro Kana is an open-source platform designed to help you learn and practice Japanese Hiragana and Katakana.

## Technology stack

Totoro Kana is built using:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
    - Svelte offers reactive, component-based architecture, enabling smooth, dynamic interfaces with minimal overhead
    - SvelteKit provides a full-stack solution, combining front-end and back-end capabilities in one framework
- [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) and [Supabase Database](https://supabase.com/database)
    - Supabase Auth takes care of secure and scalable authentication, while the Supabase database provides a fully
      managed, high-performance PostgreSQL
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
    - A type-safe ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that ensures compile-time validation of database queries, reducing
      runtime errors
    - Drizzle ORM’s migration support allows for easy schema evolution while maintaining data integrity
- [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/)
    - Skeleton offers a minimalist design framework that complements Tailwind’s utility-first CSS approach, making it
      easier and quicker to create responsive and visually appealing interfaces
