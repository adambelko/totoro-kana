				Totoro, the beloved character from Studio Ghibli’s <a
					href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/"
					class="anchor"
					target="_blank">My Neighbor Totoro</a
				> (となりのトトロ, Tonari no Totoro), represents curiosity, wonder, and a magical connection
				with nature. These qualities reflect the spirit of learning, where curiosity leads to growth
				and discovery.
			</p>
			<p>
				I named this website “Totoro Kana” to capture the sense of exploration and joy in learning
				Japanese syllables. Just as Totoro guides the characters through new experiences, Totoro
				Kana guides learners through Hiragana and Katakana, making the journey both enjoyable and
				memorable.

			<p>Hey, my name is Adam!</p>
			<p>
				I enjoy creating things for the web, and since I’m also passionate about learning Japanese,
				I thought it would be great to build a platform where people can learn and practice Hiragana
				and Katakana.
